The purpose of the project was to use the Machine Learning knowledge in a real situation, at my own choice. The theme I chose was to study x-ray images to classify them between healthy lungs x-ray images and pneumonia lungs x-ray images, because I've always been interested in the way computational science can help medical topics, and I wanted to know a little more about it.",poster_xray.pdf,Poster

Each of these have specific applications, related to the edges structure of the graph.",Johnson.pdf,Document
